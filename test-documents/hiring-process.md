# Engineering Hiring Process

## Overview

Hiring great engineers is critical to Werkly's success. This guide covers our hiring process and what we look for.

## Our Hiring Philosophy

- **Culture fit**: Align with our values
- **Growth potential**: Can reach next level

**We don't require**:

- Can they communicate? (cover letter, writing)
- Relevant experience? (doesn't need to be exact match)

**Timeline**: Review within 3 business days

**Outcome**:

- Draw architecture
- Discuss tradeoffs
- Scale considerations

**Round 2 - Coding**:
- Similar to technical screen but deeper
- More complex problem
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

**Round 3 - Team Fit**:
- Meet potential teammates

- Cultural fit discussion
- Q&A about team/role

**Round 4 - Behavioral**:
- Past experiences
- How you handle conflict
- Learning from failure

- "Debug this React component with performance issues"
- "Design an API for document upload with progress tracking"

**Difficulty**: Appropriate to level (junior vs senior)

### Behavioral Interview

**Tell me about a time when...**:
- You disagreed with a teammate's approach

Hi [Name],

Thanks for interviewing with Werkly! While we enjoyed meeting you, we've decided not to move forward at this time.

Specifically, we're looking for someone with more experience in distributed systems and scaling APIs. Your React skills were impressive, but the role requires stronger backend expertise.

We'd love to stay in touch as your career progresses. Feel free to apply again in the future if the role fits better.

Best of luck!
