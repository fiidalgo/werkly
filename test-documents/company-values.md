# Werkly Company Values

## Our Mission

Empower every employee with instant, intelligent, and personalized workplace guidance—making work more productive and less frustrating.

## Core Values

### 1. Customer Obsession 🎯

**We start with the customer and work backwards.**

**In practice**:
- Ship features customers actually want
- Respond to support tickets in < 4 hours
- Get on customer calls to understand pain
- Measure success by customer outcomes, not our output

**Examples**:
- Before building, ask: "Does this solve a customer problem?"
- When in doubt, talk to a customer
- Every engineer does customer support rotation

**Anti-pattern**: Building features we think are cool but customers don't need

### 2. Bias for Action ⚡

**Speed matters. Decisions > Deliberation.**

**In practice**:
- Ship MVPs, iterate fast
- Make reversible decisions quickly
- Don't wait for perfect
- "Done is better than perfect"

**Examples**:
- Launch in 1 week with 80% vs 2 months with 100%
- Make the decision in 1 meeting, not 5
- Commit code daily, not weekly

**Anti-pattern**: Analysis paralysis, waiting for consensus on small decisions

### 3. High Standards 📊

**Good enough isn't good enough.**

**In practice**:
- Code reviews catch issues
- Manual testing before every deploy
- No broken features in production
- Refactor when code smells

**Examples**:
- "This works but is confusing" → Rewrite it
- "95% of tests pass" → Fix the 5%
- "Users can work around this bug" → Still fix it

**Anti-pattern**: Shipping known bugs, sloppy code, "we'll fix it later"

### 4. Ownership 🔑

**Act like an owner, not a renter.**

**In practice**:
- See something broken? Fix it (don't wait for someone else)
- Think long-term (2-3 years), not just this sprint
- Make decisions as if spending your own money
- Take pride in your work

**Examples**:
- Found a bug in someone else's code? You fix it
- See a process that's inefficient? Propose improvements
- Documentation outdated? Update it

**Anti-pattern**: "That's not my job", "Someone else will handle it"

### 5. Transparency 🪟

**Default to sharing information.**

**In practice**:
- Public Slack channels > private DMs
- Share work-in-progress
- Admit mistakes openly
- Document decisions

**Examples**:
- Post standup updates in #engineering
- Share metrics dashboards company-wide
- Product roadmap is public internally
- Salary bands are transparent

**Anti-pattern**: Information hoarding, surprising people, hidden agendas

### 6. Continuous Learning 📚

**We're always getting better.**

**In practice**:
- Share learnings from mistakes
- Lunch & learns every Friday
- $2K/year learning budget
- Celebrate experiments (even failed ones)

**Examples**:
- Retrospectives after every project
- Share interesting articles in #learning
- Try new technologies in side projects
- Teach others what you learned

**Anti-pattern**: "We've always done it this way", fear of trying new things

### 7. Diversity & Inclusion 🌍

**Different perspectives make us stronger.**

**In practice**:
- Hire for diversity of thought and background
- Create psychologically safe environment
- Everyone's voice matters
- Challenge biases

**Examples**:
- "Let's hear from people who haven't spoken yet"
- Diverse candidate slate for every role
- Inclusive language in all communications
- ERGs (Employee Resource Groups) supported

**Anti-pattern**: Groupthink, ignoring quiet voices, unconscious bias
