# Performance Review Process

## Overview

Performance reviews happen quarterly at Werkly. This guide explains the process, expectations, and how to prepare.

## Review Cycle

### Quarterly Reviews

**Timeline**:
- Q1: January (Year planning)
- Q2: April
- Q3: July
- Q4: October (Includes annual review)

**What's reviewed**:
- Goal achievement (OKRs)
- Values alignment
- Growth and development
- Compensation (annual only)

### Annual Review (Q4)

**Includes**:
- Full year performance summary
- Promotion consideration
- Compensation adjustment
- Next year's goals

## OKR Framework

### What are OKRs?

**Objectives and Key Results** - How we set and measure goals

**Objective**: What you want to achieve
**Key Results**: How you measure success (3-5 per objective)

### Example OKR

**Objective**: Make Werkly's chat the fastest in class

**Key Results**:
1. Reduce time-to-first-token to < 1s (Currently: 1.8s)
2. Achieve 99.9% uptime (Currently: 99.5%)
3. Increase user satisfaction to 4.8/5 (Currently: 4.3/5)

### Setting Good OKRs

**Good OKRs are**:
- **Specific**: Clear what success looks like
- **Measurable**: Numbers, not "improve"
- **Ambitious**: 70% achievement is good
- **Relevant**: Aligned with company goals
- **Time-bound**: Quarterly timeline

**Examples**:

✅ Good: "Reduce API response time from 2s to 1s"
❌ Bad: "Make APIs faster"

✅ Good: "Ship proactive suggestions to 100% of users"
❌ Bad: "Work on new features"

### Scoring

At quarter end:
- **0.0-0.3**: Off track (didn't achieve)
- **0.4-0.6**: On track (partial achievement)
- **0.7-1.0**: Exceeds (full or over-achievement)

**Target**: 0.7 average (70% achievement)

**Note**: 1.0 means you didn't set ambitious enough goals!

### Addressing Feedback You Disagree With

**Do**:

## Prep for Your Review

### Self-Assessment Tips

**Track accomplishments** throughout quarter:
- Keep a "brag document"
- Save positive feedback
- Note wins and learnings

**Be honest about**:
- What went well
- What didn't
- Where you need support

### Example Accomplishments

✅ Good: "Reduced chat API response time from 2.1s to 0.9s by implementing streaming and caching, resulting in 15% increase in user satisfaction"

❌ Bad: "Worked on performance improvements"

### Questions to Ask Manager

- Where do you see me in 2 years?
- What's my biggest blindspot?
- Who should I learn from?
- What would unlock the next level?
- Am I on track for promotion?

## After Your Review

### Process Feedback

- Review notes from meeting
- Create action plan
- Set up 30-day check-in
- Update IDP in BambooHR

### Give Upward Feedback

Your manager wants feedback too:
- What's working well?
- What could they do differently?
- How can they support you better?
