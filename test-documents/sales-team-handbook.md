## Email Templates

### Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Cutting onboarding costs by 80% at [Company]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is growing quickly ([X] recent hires on LinkedIn). Congrats!

Quick question: How much time does your team spend onboarding new hires?

Most companies we work with spend 2-4 weeks per employee. We help cut that to 3-5 days with AI-powered, role-specific training.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Follow-up (No Response)

**Subject**: Re: Cutting onboarding costs

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from last week. 

Happy to share a 2-minute video showing how [Similar Company] reduced their onboarding time from 3 weeks to 5 days.

Want me to send it over?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Post-Demo

**Subject**: Werkly pilot proposal for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Great chatting today! As discussed, here's what a 30-day pilot would look like:

**Scope**:
- 2 teams (~20 employees)
- All your company docs uploaded
- Weekly check-ins
- Success metrics tracked

**Investment**: $0 for the pilot

**Timeline**: Start next Monday, results in 30 days

**Next Steps**: I'll send a calendar invite for our kickoff call.

Sound good?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Handling Objections

### "We already have a knowledge base"

**Response**: "That's great! Most companies do. The difference is Werkly makes it conversational and role-specific. Instead of searching through hundreds of docs, employees just ask questions and get exactly what they need. Plus, it learns what people actually need to know based on what's being asked."

### "This seems expensive"

**Response**: "Let's do the math together. How much are you spending on onboarding now? [Calculate]. Most companies save 10x what they pay us. Want to see the ROI calculator?"

### "We need to think about it"

**Response**: "Totally understand. What specific concerns can I help address? [Pause for answer]. Also, what would make this a no-brainer for you?"

### "Our IT team needs to review security"

**Response**: "Absolutely! I'll send over our security documentation. We're SOC 2 compliant, use enterprise-grade encryption, and have RLS policies for data isolation. Happy to have our CTO join a call with your IT team."

### "We'll wait until next quarter"

**Response**: "I get it. Just so you know, the companies who start now save an average of $50K in Q1 alone. What if we started with a small pilot to prove ROI before next quarter's budget planning?"

## Competitive Intel

### Trainual

**Their Strength**: Easy to create training courses
**Their Weakness**: Static content, not AI-powered, not role-specific
**Our Edge**: "Trainual requires someone to build courses. Werkly automatically answers questions from your existing docs."

### Guru

**Their Strength**: Browser extension, Slack integration
**Their Weakness**: Manual knowledge curation, not AI-powered
**Our Edge**: "Guru requires manual tagging and categorization. Werkly uses AI to automatically understand and retrieve relevant information."

### Generic ChatGPT

**Their Strength**: Everyone knows it
**Their Weakness**: No company context, no data privacy
**Our Edge**: "ChatGPT doesn't know about YOUR company. Werkly is trained on YOUR docs, keeps YOUR data private, and gives YOUR-company-specific answers."

## Compensation

### Commission Structure

- **Base**: $60K/year
- **OTE**: $120K/year
- **Commission**: 20% of first-year ARR
